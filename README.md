# Music-Visualisations-with-Houdini
Includes basic setup for music visualisations inside of Houdini.

Created in Houdini 20.547. Recommended to open in Houdini 20.*

This collection showcases how one can utilize Houdini for music visualizations, as part of my second Bachelor Thesis. To simplify matters and because I do not hold the rights to distribute the models from my thesis, I created this file. It serves as an initial resource for individuals who discover my thesis and seek inspiration or a starting point for their audio visualization journey.
